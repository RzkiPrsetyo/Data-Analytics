# How to Run Streamlit Dashboard

This functions as a brief guide on using the Streamlit dashboard. Make sure you have installed all required libraries before initiating the application. The ipynb file is not essential, as it was specifically used for extensive data cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) before creating the data dashboard.
## Install Dependencies

To install the necessary libraries, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
